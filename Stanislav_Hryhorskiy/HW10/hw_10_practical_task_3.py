# *** Practical task 3 ***
# Create an employee class. Each employee has characteristics such as name and salary.
# The class should have a counter that calculates the total number of employees,
# as well as a method that prints the total number of employees and a method that
# displays information about each employee in particular, namely the name and salary.
# In addition to creating a class, display information about the base classes from
# which the employee class is inherited (__base__), the class namespace (__dict__),
# the class name (__name__), the module name in which the class is defined (__module__),
# the documentation bar (__doc__).
