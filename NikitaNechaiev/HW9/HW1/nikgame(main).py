'''
A game script that randomly generates a number from a range of
1 to 100 and asks the user to guess that number in 10 tries.
The program reads the numbers entered by the user and prompts the user
whether the guessed number is greater or less than the number entered by the
user. The game must continue until the user has used 10 attempts and guessed
the number. If the user guessed the number, the program prints a
congratulatory message, and if 10 attempts have been exhausted and the user
did not have time to guess the number, then the corresponding message is
displayed.
(Used import random module,
and from it the randint() function)
